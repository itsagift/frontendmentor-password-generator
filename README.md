## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Generate a password based on the selected inclusion options
- Copy the generated password to the computer's clipboard
- See a strength rating for their generated password
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

- Svelte
- HTML/CSS
- Javascript

### What I learned

I wanted to use a Javascript framework, and decided to use Svelte instead of making a separate React app -- as advertised, it's more lightweight and flexible for this sort of basic application. 

I also wanted to improve my skills in Svelte -- although it's not as common as React, I think learning multiple frameworks can really help you grow as a developer.



### Continued development

Would love to continue using Svelte for smaller projects like this and see how I can incorporate it into larger projects.

### Useful resources

- [Svelte Docs](https://svelte.dev/docs) - The Svelte docs and tutorial are fantastic. Some of the best out there. 
- [HTML5 Meter Element](https://css-tricks.com/html5-meter-element/) - I didn't end up finding a use for the HTML5 meter tag in this project, but I learned that it existed through this article! I'll definitely watch out for other use cases.
